# Dask
Simple Streamlit app for CSV querying with OpenAI's API.

To use this app, follow these steps:

1. Download the codebase/clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements file. This can be done by using the command:
```pip install  -r requirements.txt```
3. In the folder, create a Python file named ```apikey.py```. Copy and paste this line in the file:
   ```apikey = (....)```, replacing the brackets with your OpenAI API key.
4. Run the app in your terminal (Command Prompt, for example) by navigating to the directory in which this folder is stored and then running:
   ```streamlit run project.py```
